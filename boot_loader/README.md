# üìù Bootloader Development Documentation (WSL + Bochs)

This document walks through the **entire process of writing, testing, and debugging a simple x86 bootloader** using NASM, Bochs, and WSL. It‚Äôs designed to help you or anyone recreate this from scratch.

## üìñ Introduction
We built a **simple x86 bootloader** that:
- Runs at system startup (BIOS loads it from the first sector of a floppy)
- Prints messages to the screen
- Loads a small "kernel" into memory and jumps to it
- All developed and tested in **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** with **Bochs** as the x86 emulator.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- **WSL (Ubuntu)** with working `apt` setup
- **NASM**: `sudo apt install nasm`
- **Bochs**: `sudo apt install bochs bochs-x bochs-sdl`
- Basic familiarity with **x86 Assembly** and BIOS services (`int 10h`, `int 13h`)

## üèóÔ∏è Step-by-Step Bootloader Creation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Writing the Bootloader (`bootstrap.asm`)
- Started with a bootloader that:
  - Sets up segment registers (important for DS, ES, etc.)
  - Displays a startup message using BIOS video interrupt (`int 10h`)
  - Loads one sector (the kernel) from floppy disk using BIOS disk interrupt (`int 13h`)
  - Jumps to the loaded kernel code at a known address
  - Contains the required **boot signature `0xAA55`** at offset 510‚Äì511
- **Key realization**: BIOS loads only sector 0 (512 bytes) to `0x7C00`. The bootloader must manually load the kernel sector.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Writing the Kernel (`test_kernel.asm`)
- A simple program that:
  - Prints a message to the screen
  - Halts in an infinite loop
- **Important**: Set `[org 0x0000]` in kernel code to match where it‚Äôs loaded into memory.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Assembling with NASM
```bash
nasm -f bin bootstrap.asm -o bootstrap.o
nasm -f bin test_kernel.asm -o test_kernel.o
